            <p class="blog_para">As I write this right now, I am not in a great mood. 
                I have slept very little over the last two days, and that has caused me 
                to have difficulties in several areas of my life. I am struggling to 
                focus in class, I just missed a discussion section for my math class 
                because I took a nap, and I don’t have the desire 
                to socialize like I normally would. But despite this, I have so much to 
                be grateful for. In fact, the things 
                that I have to be grateful for far outweigh the few negative things 
                I can identify, even if I tried my hardest to seek the negative. 
                So often we choose to selectively focus on the negative things in 
                our lives and that leads us to develop a negative perception of 
                ourselves as a whole. But, for the vast majority of us, the positives 
                far outweigh the negatives. To prove this, I will make a list of all 
                of the things I have to be grateful for.

            <p class="blog_para">I could keep on going. Probably forever. 
                But If I tried to point out all the negative aspects of my life,
                 I would quickly run out of ideas. And so, what’s the point
                  in focusing on the negatives? If I had a bad night of 
                  sleep, so what? I still have 100 things to be grateful 
                  for. If I missed a day at the gym, so what? I still have
                   a loving father in heaven. One who became a human 
                   being and was nailed to a cross. One who forgave me of all my 
                   sins and offers me eternal life in heaven. Nothing I 
                   will ever experience on this earth, none of my 
                   suffering, pain, or reasons to complain compares 
                   even fractionally to the pain that Jesus felt on 
                   that cross and he deserved none of it. He endured the 
                   full wrath of God, so that I may live this life 
                   worry-free, complaint-free, and with the freedom 
                   and joy that my sins are no longer seen by God. I 
                   have so many reasons to be grateful that I ought 
                   to be joyful every minute of every day.
